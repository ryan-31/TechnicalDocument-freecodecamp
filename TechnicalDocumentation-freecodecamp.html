    <p id = "section-text"> <strong>There are less than 75 Javan Rhinos left on earth. </strong> The Javan rhino is a smaller and lighter relative of the <a href = "https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/greater-one-horned-rhino">greater one-horned rhino<a>. It stands at 1.4 to 1.7 metres tall at the shoulder. There is not much difference in size between the males and females, and from information gathered in Ujung Kulon and from museum skeletons, there is a possibility that females are slightly bigger. Javan rhinos are estimated to live an average of 35 to 40 years in the wild. Javan rhinos have long, sharp, dagger-shaped lower incisor teeth. These are used in fighting and can inflict deep wounds. Javan rhinos also have two rows of 6 strong, broad and low-crowned molars on each side. The ridges of enamel on these teeth are used to cut up the woody parts of their food into characteristic 1-2 cm long pieces. Over the years the teeth wear down by several centimetres to become shallow and dish-like, and making it difficult for older rhinos to break down their food. </p>
  <center><code id = "code"> Javan Rhino Fun Fact: The Javan Rhino is the most shy of all rhinos, using their dung and urine to communicate instead of sound. </code></center><br>
   <p id= "section-text">Javan rhinos have a single horn, grey or brownish in colour, usually less than 20 cm long. Males have larger horns and many females, especially in Ujung Kulon, have no horn or just have a small knob on the nose. The longest horn ever recorded is only about 27 cm long and is now in the British Museum in London. Rhino horn has the same horn structure as the hooves of horses and re-grows if broken off. It is not used for fighting, but for scraping mud from the sides of wallows, pulling down food plants, and for protection of the head and nose when breaking through dense vegetation</p>

    <p id = "section-text">The world's only Javan Rhinos live in Ujung Kulon National Park, in Indonesia. </p><br>
      <p id = "section-text"> Male Javan Rhinos have territories that are approx. 12-20 km2, and only marginally overlap with other males territories. There is no indication that these territories are actually defended by territorial fights as happens in other rhino species, but they are marked along the main trails by urine, faeces, scrapes and twisted saplings.</p><br>
    <p id = "section-text">The ranges of the females in Ujung Kulon are much smaller (3-14 km2) and overlap each other considerably. </p>
    <center><code>Pregnancy of a Javan Rhino lasts between 16-19 months. That is double the time it takes for a human to grow!</code></center>
   <p id = "section-text">There is a short period of courtship around the time when a female is in oestrus and this is generally the only time adult males and adult females socialise. Javan Rhinos are not vocal, unlike their cousins the Sumatran Rhino, which is nicknamed the <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IrAT5mlPNk">Singing Rhino.</a></p>
     <center><code>Javan Rhino Fun Fact: Do not approach a Javan Rhino! They are aggressive and will attack humans charging their long, sharp lower teeth into victims and potentially causing dangerous, often deadly wounds.</code></center>
     <p id = "section-text">Javan rhinos used to live in a variety of tropical landscapes, both lowland and highland, from the mangroves of the Sunderbans in India and Bangladesh, the mountains of southern China, to the sub-montane shrubs on the highest volcanoes of Java. The Javan rhino probably had a wider ecological range than either its larger relative, the greater one-horned rhino, or its compatriot, the Sumatran rhino
